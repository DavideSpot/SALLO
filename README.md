Welcome to the Suite for the Assessment of Low Level cues on Orientation (SALLO) Unity Package. SALLO is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to simplify the development of psychophysical experiments focused on spatial orientation in Unity projects.

## Features

SALLO is built on the understanding that psychophysical experiments can be divided into four essential sub-elements:

1. **Stimulus:** Define and manipulate the visual or sensory stimuli presented to participants.
2. **Task:** Implement experimental tasks that participants need to perform in response to the stimuli.
3. **Psychophysical Method:** Apply various psychophysical methods to quantify perceptual experiences.
4. **Spatial Positioning:** Control the spatial arrangement and positioning of elements within the virtual environment.

Therefore, SALLO includes template game objects and base components that cover each sub-element of the psychophysical experiment. The tools included in SALLO provide a reference base that developers can customize easily to their needs, so as to speed up and simplify the experiment development. 

## Installation

Import SALLO in your project using [Unity's Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html).

In your open Unity project:
1. Go to `Window` > `Package Manager`.
2. Click on the add (+) button, choosing the git url option.
3. copypaste the git url to this repository and click import
4. You're all set! You can now start using the SALLO tools in your Unity project.

## Getting Started

SALLO contains a sample experiment to get you started quickly. The sample experiment requires the [Unity Experiment Framework](https://immersivecognition.com/unity-experiment-framework/). You can install it from their github page, or you can import the unitypackage file of the UXF version provided within the SALLO sample experiment folder.

For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the SALLO paper (incoming) and to the [SALLO API Documentation](https://davidespot.github.io/SALLO).
